description: >
  Simple GitHub Action to run multiple Rust workflows,
  including test, clippy, fmt, doc, and shear.

  Usable as a default baseline for Rust projects.

  By default, it caches all installed tools between runs.

  Ideally used in combination with sccache actions to cache
  compiled artifacts between runs.

  See https://github.com/Mozilla-Actions/sccache-action for sccache setup.
